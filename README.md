# JSON schema for the Camera Trap Metadata Schema
See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5267527/ for the paper that defines this standard. As part of that paper, a JSON template is supplied but having a schema for validation is really what we need. So here it is :D

Big thanks to https://jsonschema.net for making schema generation simple.

# TODO
 - Fill in `titles`, `description`, `default` (if applicable) and `examples` fields in the schema.
